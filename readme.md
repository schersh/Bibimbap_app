#Bibimbap App

This application is my fourth project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. This app is a rice bowl recipe generator, built with AngularJS and Firebase. I selected Angular as the front-end framework for this project, because I wanted to create an interactive single-page application. I chose Firebase for my database because I wanted something lightweight, and my dataset doesn't require any complex or structured relational modeling. I was curious to discover more about the difference between HTTP and Websockets technology, so using Firebase offered a great learning opportunity.

##User Stories:


1. With a single click, a user can generate a recipe for a well-balance, nutritional rice bowl.

2. A user can enter and save their own ingredients to add more variety and flavors to the recipes.

##Struggles/Unsolved Problems

I am still working to understand how to build the most efficient file structure for an Angular application. Figuring out proper naming conventions properly link my Controllers and ViewModels took much longer than I anticipated.

In addition, deciding to use a new database type for my backend required more time for debugging than I expected, and I still do not have full CRUD functionality on the app at this point. I plan to continue working on this aspect of the project, because once I become fully familiar with using Firebase, I think it will be a very powerful tool.
